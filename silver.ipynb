      "0 : conair cs15tcs professional straight styles straightening iron woah ! sure this straightener looks like all the other crappy straightners in the world , but there 's a twist to this one ! it is my first straightner and i 've had it for about 7 months . i bought it only because i was desperate for a cheap straightener because my hair is very thick , long , wavy ! i 'm looking for a new straighner right now ... but until then this one is doing just fine . if it works for me , it will work for you !\n",
      "1 : barbie ballet shoes icon doll i was looking round the toysrus website and found this cheap doll ! \" wow \" i said . so i got it and her body is painted on ! which is really cute ! , parents would n't you like to get a toy where you save yourself from picking up another barbie item from the floor ! well , make a cardboard dancefloor and she can do her piroettes happily . her shoes are very pretty ! , pink with laces ! her hair is very good quality and easy to style ! get her !\n",
      "2 : cloud b twilight constellation night light i bought this item because it had good reviews , and looked really cool . it 's a turtle with 3 different colored led lights on the inside that are supposed to project stars in a room or on a ceiling . of the 3 colors green , amber and blue only the green and blue are noticable in pitch black . the amber is almost a waisted option because you ca n't see it . my problem with this item is it only works in pitch black , and barely in that case . the product shots show it sitting on a nursery floor shining up at the ceiling , this is sooooo impossible . the turtle needs to be at least 2 feet from the ceiling in order to see any of the stars . a total disappointment . i returned it .\n",
      "3 : alessi zuppa toscana tuscan white bean soup ( pack of 6 ) this soup taste great . even better if you add the olive oil and grated parm cheese . only takes about 15 mins to make . the package arrived quick . ordered on sunday night , had tuesday morning ( used prime , 2 shipping ) a day early . i will probably order a few more boxes very soon .\n",
      "4 : swedish beauty amaretto tanning lotion advanced dark tanning system with triple bronzer and shimmer i ordered this because i was running low on my current tanning lotion which i love and it smells like skittles , so i read the reviews for this one that was supposed to smell like cherries or almonds and it does not smell like either . it just has a chemical odor and has so much bronzer in it that i really have to make sure to wipe my hands off . i will definitely be ordering some more of my original lotion to replace this nasty stuff .\n",
      "5 : stash green white tea blends , 18 or 20 count tea bags ( pack of 6 ) i 've been tasting along several green tea 's trying to find one that i liked . i was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks . one would be too strong , the other too bland . i think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass , making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil . i found the mint to be nicely pronounced , and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable , with a little bit of honey it 's really good . so if you 're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine , and like me you like it mildly paired with mint . then give this tea a shot . ( i do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first , so that you 're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine )\n",
      "6 : mama mio tummy rub stretch mark butter , 4 oz , say no to stretch marks ! i started with the mama mio oil and loved it so much i had to try the belly butter . it 's wonderful . smells great and absorbs really well . on days when i really want to make my belly soft i use the oil followed by the belly butter . i 've tried several on the market and this is the best . wish it was n't so pricey ... but that 's my only beef with it .\n",
      "7 : tiny love super deluxe lights and music gymini activity gym we gifted this toy to our niece nimisha when she was completing 2 months .. initially she spent only few minutes in this gym .. but as she grows she seems fascinated about the gym and absolutely loves it . she is now 5 months old and she enjoys pulling and kicking at the toys . we like the aspect that there are additional hooks to hang more toys . over all it is a good value for the money .\n",
      "8 : oral b professional care 1000 power toothbrush yes yes yes ! i love this toothbrush ! i will never be able to use a manual toothbrush again . i look forward to that quot fresh from the dentist quot feeling every time i brush my teeth . my wisdom teeth grew in without problems , so i still have them back there and they are the most difficult teeth to brush . my manual toothbrush simply was n't doing the job . if you think about it , the shape of a regular toothbrush just is n't made to get to the back molars very well . now , not only are they getting brushed , they are getting polished ! even the very back back of the teeth themselves thanks to the nice small round shape of the brushhead combined with the fast pulsating action . my gums are healthy and every one of my teeth are white and plaque free , what else can i say ?\n",
      "9 : kick play piano with music , sounds twinkling lights i purchased this toy for my son before he was born and started using it at about 2 months of age . he is now 8 months old and has kicked it vigorously many times and it still works great . i do n't think it is very educational except that he has learned that when he kicks it or touches it ( when i lay it on the floor for him ) it plays sounds and lights up . the tone of the music is soft to the ears , lights up colorfully , and the animal sounds are adorable . you can select several activities by the turn of a knob which is great so that child nor parents will get frusted of the repetiveness . i have bought this piano for several of my friends for thier infants and they love it ! great entertainer for a child .\n",

      "1 : natural factors whey factors chocolate works well , but there is a lot of dead space in the container when you first open it up . the container comes 3 4 4 5 full and the rest in empty space .\n",
      "2 : clif bar builder 's bar , 2 . 4 ounce bars i love the peanut butter builder 's bars . while amazon is great for so many things , a trip to tj 's is too good to pass up . a little cup of coffee , a sample or two and into the cart with some fresh vegetables and whatever else is irresistible that day . life does n't get much better . if tj 's were n't local ( perish the thought ! ) , i 'd order the bars from amazon . with amazon 's sales volume , 2 day fedex delivery and a sheltered place for the packages when they arrive , freshness has n't been a problem .\n",
      "3 : andis 1875 watt professional ceramic ionic hair dryer i was a little hesitant to purchase since it was rather cheap for a good ionic dryer but it worked great . i have 3c type hair and it dried my hair rather quickly and straight , with minimal frizz but it did die out exactly a year later . so i guess you get what you pay for .... but it was good while it lasted .\n",
      "4 : clif bar energy bars these were cheaper than what i had bought at sam 's and worked very well . they are very convient and i would recommend them to anyone not willing to make their own at a cheaper price because of the convience of having a good product , at a somewhat reasonable price compared to the marketplace . they tasted very good , maybe too good , my grands love them and could consume them at a high rate . then i had to consume them to keep up with their energy . truth is i probably needed them a lot more than they did . it was a good experience and i will buy them again when i do n't have the time to make homemade ones .\n",
      "5 : gillette fusion power cartridges until i tried fusion catridges , i got decent shaves but not great . i was always cutting myself atleast once a week , especially on my chin . now , i get the smooth shaves and i never cut myself . i also think the shaves are closest to the skin that is possible for me . razors today are vastly superior to razors twenty years ago . i grew a beard for two years to avoid shaving . it seems every 2 3 years , a new shaving product comes out that is much better . i think fusion is that product . i like the power option as it seems my shaves are faster but maybe it is psychological . i like shaving now because of fusion .\n",
      "6 : fisher price bright beginnings stacking action blocks we played with these at a friend 's house when our son was about 10 months old . he really enjoyed playing with them then . we bought him his own set for his first birthday . he played with them for a little while , but now , at 18 months , never pulls them out to play with them anymore . we should 've gotten them when he was about 6 months old or so .\n",
